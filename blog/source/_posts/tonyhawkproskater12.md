Let me start by stating what I’m sure you’ve already heard. If you liked the originals then you’re in for a treat. This is a really solid remake. It hit every beat I wanted it to. 

I cherished the originals like I’m sure some of you did. They really nailed the feeling of scraping together these crazy combos that spawn the map clearing cartoonish obstacles and hunting down that last bell that seems to escape you right at the last second. 

All with the punk music you’d expect perfectly merged with the crisp atmospheric sounds of a skateboard wheel carving through pavement and slapping down on a rail after hitting some random flip trick. 

There’s a nice skate shop, with not as much customization as I was hoping for, but just enough to get by. 

The stat system was a fun progression. But similar to the originals once you’ve maxed out the 4 primary stats you use it’s all set. I’m sure there’s some interesting setups revolving around the 700 some pro skater specific challenges. But by and large if you stick to a custom character you won’t be shocked by anything you find in that department.

It really feels like a fresh render, new shaders and the necessary modern QOL changes you’d expect. All slapped on a truly fantastic base game. 

For those of you who won’t be just riding a nostalgia high it’s still a purchase recommendation from me. But here’s the short of it. 

### What You'll Like
* $40 AA price point
* Tricky but rewarding combo-based game play
* A healthy mix of hidden content the game pushes you towards finding
* Very fun well crafted tunes
* User made custom maps
* A mix of modern skate brands and classics (I’m looking at you [Element](https://www.elementbrand.com/)) you’ll appreciate. 

### What You Won't Like
* If you’re not interested in the extra challenges you can blow through most of the maps
* Can get repetitive 
* It doesn’t really get that much more difficult
