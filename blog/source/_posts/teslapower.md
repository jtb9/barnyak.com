Riding on the back of Nikola Tesla through our modern history [Emrod](https://emrod.energy/) is going to [move forward](https://emrod.energy/press-release-nz-start-up-launches-world-first-long-range-wireless-power-transmission/#:~:text=The%20Emrod%20technology%20works%20by,in%20cooperation%20with%20Callaghan%20Innovation.) with a plan to test out "Wireless" power distribution in a commercial setting.

120 years later Tesla is finally getting his dream.  Emrod, founded by Greg Kushnir, can move power between 2 static, predefined locations.  While claiming that:
* There's no radiation around the beam
* Atmospheric conditions should pose no interference (Atleast that would effect power distribution)
* A "low power laser safety curtain" that cuts power when a drone, bird or other object is about to cross into the power beam

They purpose a really cool use-case for this power, which is distributing trucks to locations where portable power will be necessary.  They call it "MOR" or Mobile Outage Response.  The thought of power going down and your local power company simply driving a truck past the disruption to then tether into the grid is certainly Sci-Fi.

`â€œWe have an abundance of clean hydro, solar, and wind energy available around the world but there are costly challenges that come with delivering that energy using traditional methods, for example, offshore wind farms or the Cook Strait here in New Zealand requiring underwater cables which are expensive to install and maintain"`
