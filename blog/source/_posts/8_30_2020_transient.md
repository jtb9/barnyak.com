## Game: [Transient](https://www.iceberg-games.com/transient/)

Transient (Iceberg Games) constantly refers to itself as cyberpunk meets H.P. Lovecraft.  And that does seem to fit the bill with the demo, screenshots and trailers they've released so far.

It's using Unreal Engine 4 so you can safely assume the camera control polish and soft vibrant post processing that usually comes with that.  But beyond that I haven't play'd the demo yet myself.

To know why i'm posting it though, just check out the trailer:

The music seems solid.  Aesthetic is a double-whammy and as long as the combat is solid and there's an interesting story this seems like an obvious pick.

The cyber-punk rally from cyberpunk 2077 may finally be starting to pay off!
