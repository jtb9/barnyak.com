The International Space Station at NASA Headquarters has a new director! **Robyn Gatens**.  She first started working for NASA in 1985 at the Marshall Space Flight Center and has since managed primarily environmental control and life support systems for human spaceflight missions.

Also the recipient of NASAâ€™s Outstanding Leadership and Exceptional Achievement Medals her resume is a perfect fit for the role and I'm very excited to see where she takes the ISS in the coming years.

We're only 62 days out from the 20th anniversary of manned operation at the International Space Station.  So this is a perfect time to pass the mantle on to a champion of manned space flight and propel the ISS into another era.
