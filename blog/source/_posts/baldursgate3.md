Baldurs Gate 3 is finally upon us!  Grab your sword, axe, staff, or bow and get ready to dive into another thousand-hour adventure!  Let's start by setting some expectations; it is in early-access.  So expect a few hiccups, strange occurrences, and straight-up bugs around the way.

For those of you not in the know, Baldurs Gate 3 is the spiritual successor to Divinity Original Sin 2.  A turn-based (but only when you're in combat or sneaking around) RPG that prides itself on immersive characters and deep story.  I consider it the gold standard for co-op RPG games.  The classes are diverse and well thought out but are all immediately recognizable.  Exploring is exciting and full of unexpected twists and turns.  Combat is challenging and very satisfying when you finally clean the house.

I'm going to do something new for this title.  Instead of playing through it and writing a formal review, I'm just going to update this every couple of sessions, as evolving feedback of my thoughts and feelings.  

### Sessions

Last night was my first session with the title since it went into early access.  I have a warrior drow (but dexterity and bow focused), and we're planning on doing an "evil" campaign.  It's been a blast.  Sure there's been some superficial bugs I'm sure you've already heard about elsewhere.  But nothing beyond minor annoyances and things being a bit odd.  The face-scans make all the characters look crazy good.  But they do seem a bit repetitive.

Combat is fantastic, as expected.  The Divinity 4 engine is gorgeous.  The increased camera controls and freedom allow you to sit there and appreciate the scenes to a higher degree.  The UI is more polished and frankly looks nicer.  It's a good, fun, classic RPG excitement.  The next session can't come sooner!!
