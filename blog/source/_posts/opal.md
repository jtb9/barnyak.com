You're looking at them!  NASA released new Hubble shots of Jupiter on August 25th.  These are crystal clear and give us a really cool insight into Jupiter's upcoming weather forecast.  Unfortunately, Jupiter's red spot is still shrinking.  It's gotten to about 9,800 miles across.

In the realm of good news, however, Red Spot Jr's has halted it's fade back to white and appears to be darkening again.  We may yet get our twin red storms of fantasy!

I'm not sure if this at the start or tail end of our yearly OPAL missions.  But we will hopefully still get some more shots before we have to wait yet another year.


#### The ongoing shrinkage of Jupiter's red spot is still a "mystery".
