Phase 3 of the EVE online Project Discovery event was announced today. 

Project Discovery is an in-game mini-game that collects real scientific data on flow cytometry and cell populations. Most notably, it's been helping understand COVID-19 more.  Since it's launch, the project has contributed.  Of those, 466,000 "verified and now able to be used in scientific research."

More MMO's should be implementing these platforms tying in what is often just filler or meaningless breaks in the core mechanics you could be contributing invaluable data, especially in our current pandemic.

It's contributing real, valuable information for us as a species.  It's fantastic on so many levels.
