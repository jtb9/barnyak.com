## Game: [Granblue Fantasy Relink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granblue_Fantasy:_Relink)

Having spent ample time with Granblue Fantasy Relink using a controller, I can confidently say the experience was highly enjoyable and immersive. My party consisted of Zeta, Ferry, Djeeta, and Rosetta, each bringing unique dynamics to the battlefield. As a fan of DPS (Damage Per Second) combat characters, I found the combat system both satisfying and fluid, allowing me to fully engage with the game’s mechanics.

While the game excels in many areas, I did find the challenge level to be somewhat lacking. Playing on action mode, I felt that the difficulty could have been ramped up to provide a more satisfying challenge. However, this did not significantly detract from my overall enjoyment, as the game offers a rich density of content that keeps you engaged and entertained.
