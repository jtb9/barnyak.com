The recently announced Always Home Cam is a giant leap in technical achievement and cultural paradigm surrounding home automation.  

Until recently, the home automation market has focused on extending your phone's utility to dedicated spaces in your home. Home automation products integrate seamlessly with your phone and other devices to attempt a digital immersion of your home. The new Always Home Cam is the next generation of true home automation.

The Always Home Cam is essentially a small, blade protected, compact drone with a camera, speaker, and microphone attached.  It can automatically find it's dock when battery levels get low, with no other important limitation on how far it can travel.  The ability to move from room to room fundamentally extends every single other home automation feature into a real "digital butler" experience.

The platforms we could create with drones like this opens the door for infinite activities. You could have it do anything from playing music for you as you clean your house or monitoring the perimeter while you're gone on vacation.

Once the proverbial cat is out of the bag regarding interior robotics (while floor and wall cleaning robots exist, they lack the total freedom and camera/mic input combination), the market is going to go crazy. With this fundamental platform the possibilities of add-on products are endless.

The idea of a realized robotic butler is no longer science fiction.  This statement alone should send your heart racing.
