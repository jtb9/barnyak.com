Overwatch elevators got a much-needed rework on the PTR! Instead of being on a constant loop, the various moving platforms have a new behavior:
* Wait at the bottom of their loop for a player to get on
* After a short delay, it rapidly moves up to the top
* After a brief pause, it then goes back down
* This movement now makes a noticeable sound effect, effectively giving away your position.
