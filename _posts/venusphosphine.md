Recently some analysis was done on the findings of the JCMT and ALMA telescopes that provides evidence with "no other plausible identification" that phosphine gas is present in Venus's Atmosphere.  With the current understanding of Venus it would be expected that phosphine would be in an oxidized form but apparently this isn't the case.  This leaves us with a heart-pounding conclusion to draw, live might be or have been on Venus.  And if it can survive there... then so can we.

This is a big deal in the realm of Astrobiology.  The main-stream best contender for life up till now was Mars.  And the academic backing behind that was primarily because of the methane gas in it's atmosphere.  However methane is more easily explainable away (Geological activity, which we now know was there int he past). It's important to not gloss over the fact that Mars having geological activity and methane *is* a big deal.  And could still serve as evidence of potential life.  But it's not as strong an indicator as phosphine gas.

For me this brings flash backs to the fantastical venus sky cities I read about in a BBC future article ([Found it](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20161019-the-amazing-cloud-cities-we-could-build-on-venus)).

Not that we've been in a lull of physics and astronomy news.  But this is just more fuel to the flame of colonization of our solar system.  I can only help it happens sooner rather then latter.
