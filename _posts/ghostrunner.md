Holy shit Ghostrunner looks really *damn* good.  Cyberpunk parkour says everything it needs to.  It's got it all: Cyberpunk textures, cyberpunk animations, cyberpunk music.  If you want anything more, frankly, you're just greedy.

#### Releasing October 27th (But a demo going live on Sep 29th on steam).

Did I mention RTX Ray Tracing?  I feel like I get another jolt of excitement every time I hear a new aspect of Ghostrunner.  The immersion of those cyber punk beats as this bad ass cyber samurai slashes from enemy to enemy puts me over the top.

If One More Level knocks this out of the park i'll probably try out God's Trigger as well.

Enough with my ramblings, here's what the publisher actually has to say.

### Description From the publisher
A cataclysm has wiped out most of humanity and destroyed the environment. Now, when resources are scarce, the survivors live in a tower built by long-forgotten hands. But the structure is torn by violence, poverty, and chaos. A person’s worth depends on the category of implants they have, defining their whole lives. It's no surprise that a rebellion starts.

You are a cyber-warrior, a living weapon, the only one capable of fighting both in the physical world and in cyberspace. Lost and hunted, thrown into the middle of the conflict, you must use this bond with technology to ascend the tower.

### Features From the publisher
* Ascend the tower – use the environment to your advantage and face fast and determined enemies.
* Act fast - armed with a melee weapon, get to the enemies before they have a chance to shoot.
* You are a cyber-warrior – fight both in the physical world and in cyberspace.
* Choose your own strategy – use your special abilities to avoid bullets and eliminate enemies: the dynamic movement system turns combat into a true dance of death. 
* Trial and error – you die from one hit, so learn the levels by heart and adapt.
* Next-gen visuals – Ghostrunner aims to bring the visuals of a blockbuster title to a more condensed indie action experience.
