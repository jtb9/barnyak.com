Interesting [work](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abac66) done by Amir Siraj and Abraham Loeb is showing that the existence of [Planet 9](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/blog/2017/10/planet-nine) is some of our strongest physical evidence for our solar system having 2 stars early in it's development.

We have not actually seen Planet 9 yet.  But some gravitational feature's of our solar system seem to imply it's existence.

In a fun twist more evidence of Planet 9 could be the smoking gun we need for a duo star development history for our own solar system.

For reference here's the orbit of ["Sedna"](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA05569) which is a crazy cold, very far out, elongated orbiting object.  Sedna's strange orbit is one of the primary pieces of evidence that a large ninth planet must exist to have put it in such an orbit.
